                        <p>All electronics such as computers, televisions, printers, laptops, cameras and smartphones that are no longer being used or discarded usually go to waste. The items which are near end-of-life end up being thrown away or refurbished if possible. It is still not common to securely dispose of electronics or recycle them. In 2019, only 17.4% of all e-waste was recycled worldwide.</p>

Only a few electronics that contain lead, mercury, or any dangerous chemicals cannot be recycled without safety measures. There are many options to recycle old or used laptops, as you can sell them online for cash or donate the items to schools.</p>

                        <p>The rising amount of e-waste is a significant threat to the environment and pollutes rivers, oceans, or land. Most electronics have precious metals like gold and palladium, which can be recovered and used in other products. Appliances and gadgets also contain toxins or chemicals that might leak into water or the ground. This can lead to health problems in adults and children.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that you recycle or dispose of old electronics as soon as you upgrade to a newer model or equipment. Many people tend to wait for a long time and end up with a pile of gadgets that no one can use. By recycling them quickly, you can prevent more e-waste from ending up in landfills.</p>

                        <p>Yes, it is important to check for certifications from eWASA. EWASA membership is one way to know your e-waste recycler is trustworthy. They provide guidance for responsible and eco-friendly practices that e-waste recyclers should follow. Since electronics are difficult to break down and have chemicals that need to be disposed of safely, businesses or facilities must follow proper measures.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, you may have to make a small payment for recycling used electronics. Companies that manage toxic e-waste can charge a fee to collect it and prevent the chemicals from leaking anywhere. Printers, old televisions and appliances that are a threat to the environment are challenging to recycle. They require expensive equipment and safe transportation, which is why you might have to pay to dispose of them.</p>

It is recommended that you erase the data and all information from computers, laptops and tablets before sending them to a recycling facility. Wipe the hard drive clean and back up the data to your cloud or storage device. Some recycling businesses also protect confidential information by erasing the drive as part of the process.</p>
