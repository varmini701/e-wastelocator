                    Health and environmental challenges
                </h3>
                <p class="info">
                    e-waste poses a huge risk to humans, animals, and the environment. The presence of heavy metals and
                    highly toxic substances such as mercury, lead, beryllium and cadmium pose a significant threat to
                    the
                    environment even in minute quantities. e-waste releases harmful chemicals, such as lead, on burning,
                    which adversely impacts human blood, kidney and the peripheral nervous system. When it is thrown in
                    landfills, the chemicals seep in the air, ground and water, affecting both the land and sea animals.
                    Decomposing e-waste is an expensive process and only a few developed countries can afford to do so.
                    These require special treatment and cannot be dumped in landfill sites.

                </h3>
                <p class="info">
                    Several agencies have said untreated e-waste also ends up in informal industries where children are
                    employed to dismantle electronics. Exposure to chemicals such as lead and mercury can adversely
                    affect children's growth and development.
                    Unprocessed e-waste poses a risk to health and the environment as it contains several toxic
                    substances such as lead, cadmium, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), etched chemicals,
                    arsenic and asbestos, which can be hazardous if not disposed of in a scientific manner. If not
                    segregated from other solid waste that finds itself at landfills, these toxic chemicals may leach
                    into the soil and hence pose an environmental risk.

                    Impact of e-waste on human health
                </h3>
                <p class="info">
                    Workers, aiming to recover valuable materials such as copper and gold, are at risk of exposure to
                    over 1,000 harmful substances, including lead, mercury, nickel, brominated flame retardants and
                    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

                    For an expectant mother, exposure to toxic e-waste can affect the health and development of her
                    unborn child for the rest of its life. Potential adverse health effects include negative birth
                    outcomes, such as stillbirth and premature births, as well as low birth weight and length. Exposure
                    to lead from e-waste recycling activities has been associated with significantly reduced neonatal
                    behavioural neurological assessment scores, increased rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity
                    disorder (ADHD), behavioural problems, changes in child temperament, sensory integration
                    difficulties, and reduced cognitive and language scores. </p>

                        In 2022, the global e-waste market was worth USD 52.6 Billion. It's expected to reach USD 160.2 Billion by 2032.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Back in 2019, the world already produced 54 million metric tons of e-waste. By 2030, this number is expected to surge to approximately 74.7 million metric tons, reflecting a 30% increase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Asia made the most e-waste in 2019 with 24.9 million tons. After Asia, the Americas and Europe made the most, with Africa and Oceania making the least.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 2021 Pirg report states that American families spend an average of $1,767 on new electronic products annually.

                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, in Europe, Norway stands out: individuals there dispose of approximately 26 kilograms of e-waste per person, with electric car batteries contributing to this statistic.
